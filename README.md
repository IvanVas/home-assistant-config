# Home Assistant Configuration

** This is a work in progress **

This repository contains my configuration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

I'm running Home Assistant on a [Intel Core I7-8565U I5-8265U Quad Core](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32850708878.html) with 32GB of ram and 1tb NVMe SSD. Its essentially an Intel Nuc knock-off.

I run Home Assistant Core on [k3s](https://k3s.io/) along with a handful of other services, checkout my [home repository](https://github.com/imduffy15/home) for all the infrastructure provisioning automation.

## Devices

### Lighting

I use a range of WiFi lights that have esp8266 chips and use the [tuya cloud](https://www.tuya.com/) platform. I flash these with [tasmota](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota). Primarily I'm using a Phillips hue emulation for control via Amazon Alexa, additionally, all devices are configured as MQTT clients and report to Home Assistant via this.

#### Bulbs

 ~~- [Novostella Smart Bulb B22 RGBCW 600lm](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07DN4NLKM) - General indoor bulb~~
 
 ~~- [Novostella B22 LED Tunable Smart Bulb RGBCW 1300lm](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07SB4Q4JT) - Indoor bulb for areas that require more light~~
 
 ~~- [Novostella E27 RGB Alexa Light Bulbs 900lm](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07NQMFJMJ) - Bulb for some of my lamps~~
 
 ~~- [Novostella RGB LED Smart Spotlight 20 W 2 LED Floodlight](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07VNR9XW7) - Outdoor flood light installed at the back of the house for lighting up the garden~~

All the above bulbs are no longer flashable with tasmota, please look at preflashed bulbs instead, Athom provide a range of B22 and E27 bulbs https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001281509550.html

#### LED Strips

 - [BTF-LIGHTING WS2811 5m DC12V 60leds/m](https://www.amazon.co.uk/BTF-LIGHTING-300LEDs-Addressable-Flexible-Non-waterproof/dp/B01CNL6K52) - My go to LED strip

### Networking

 - [Ubiquiti EdgeMAX EdgeRouter X - ER-X](https://linitx.com/product/ubiquiti-unifi-in-wall-802.11ac-wave-2-wi-fi-access-point---uap-iw-hd/14588) - I've went back and forth between this and the Unifi USG, figured the EdgeRouter was better value for money. Been happy with it so far, gone between Stock firmware and OpenWRT a few times but have settled on the stock firmware
 - [Ubiquiti UniFi In-Wall 802.11ac Wave 2 Wi-Fi Access Point - UAP-IW-HD](https://linitx.com/product/ubiquiti-unifi-in-wall-802.11ac-wave-2-wi-fi-access-point---uap-iw-hd/15499) * 6
 - [Ubiquiti UniFi 24 Port 250W PoE Gigabit Network Switch US-24-250W](https://linitx.com/product/ubiquiti-unifi-in-wall-802.11ac-wave-2-wi-fi-access-point---uap-iw-hd/14252) - Switch, for the moment I only have one of them, will likely be adding more. Slightly disappointed that I didn't get something with L3 functionality as intervlan communications must go back to the router
 - [Ubiquiti UniFi Cloud Key Controller Gen2 Plus](https://linitx.com/product/ubiquiti-unifi-in-wall-802.11ac-wave-2-wi-fi-access-point---uap-iw-hd/15498) - originally purchased to manage my unifi gear but is now unused as the unifi controller software runs along side Home Assistant. If anyone in Ireland/UK is interested in a second hand barely used one let me know.

### Television

 - [TvHeadEnd](https://tvheadend.org/) - Runs along side home assistant. Provides Live TV over the network
